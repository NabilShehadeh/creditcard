## Model Description

This model is designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time using a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms and unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. The model processes anonymized transaction features and behavioral patterns to predict the probability of fraud.

### Architecture

The model uses an ensemble approach combining:

- **Autoencoder**: Unsupervised anomaly detection for novel fraud patterns

### Key Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-100ms prediction latency
- **Explainability**: SHAP-based feature importance and explanations
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Multiple techniques for handling rare fraud cases
- **Temporal Awareness**: Time-based validation and feature engineering
- **Robust Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and outliers gracefully

## Intended Use

| **Ensemble** | **0.871** | **0.951** | **0.68** | **0.35** |

### Validation Strategy
- **Time-based Split**: Train on older data, validate on newer data
- **Rolling Window CV**: 5-fold time series cross-validation
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Final holdout period for unbiased evaluation
- **Class Balance**: Stratified sampling to maintain fraud rate

## Model Limitations

### Known Limitations
1. **Data Dependency**: Performance depends on quality of anonymized features
2. **Concept Drift**: Model may degrade over time as fraud patterns evolve
3. **Novel Attacks**: May miss completely new fraud patterns not seen in training
4. **False Positives**: Legitimate transactions may be flagged as fraud
5. **Feature Availability**: Requires all V1-V28 features to be present

### Performance Considerations
- **Latency**: Model requires ~50ms for single prediction
- **Throughput**: Can handle ~1000 predictions/second
- **Memory**: Requires ~500MB RAM for model and explainer
- **CPU**: Optimized for multi-core processing

### Bias and Fairness
- **Geographic Bias**: Training data may not represent all geographic regions
- **Temporal Bias**: Model trained on specific time periods
- **Demographic Bias**: No demographic information available for fairness analysis
- **Merchant Bias**: May perform differently across merchant categories

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy
- **No PII**: Model uses only anonymized features
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary features are processed
- **Secure Storage**: Models and data stored with encryption
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls for model and data

### Fairness
- **Equal Treatment**: Model treats all transactions equally regardless of source
